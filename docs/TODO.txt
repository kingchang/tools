- How to exit with a custom user defined error message?
- Abstract more how things are processed? E.g. parameter names to options, etc.
- Improve README as home page.
- Move docs requirements to setup.py?
- How to document parameterized types? tuple[(None, six.text_type), list[Argument]]
- Put documentation in http://pythonhosted.org/ and redirect to Read The Docs.
- Better to name CHANGELOG? Append contents to "long_description"?
- List alternative projects? E.g. argh, argfarce, argtools, argdeclare.
- Use Attest for testing? Nose? Tox?
- Review? http://thechangelog.com/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project/
- Somehow integrate profiling in tests? Fail if it goes over X seconds?
- Show off Travis CI and Coveralls badges?
- Use more code check tools? flake8, pyflakes, pylint, pychecker?
- Test on Python 3.4. as well, <https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1989>.
