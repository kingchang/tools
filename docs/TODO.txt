- Incorrect module data documentation on RTD? Old Sphinx version?
- Why isn't "__version__" and "__features__" automatically autodoc'ed?
- Test "setup.py" for installation via PyPI and via source.
- Fix Sphinx build warning.
- Abstract more how things are processed? E.g. parameter names to options, etc.
- Improve README to be usable as a web page.
- How to document parameterized types? tuple[(None, six.text_type), list[Argument]]
- Put documentation in http://pythonhosted.org/ and redirect to Read The Docs.
- Better to name CHANGELOG? Append contents to "long_description"?
- List alternative projects? E.g. argh, argfarce, argtools, argdeclare.
- Use Attest for testing? Nose? Tox? Pytest?
- Review? http://thechangelog.com/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project/
- Somehow integrate profiling in tests? Benchmark every change to find performance regressions.
- Show off Travis CI and Coveralls badges?
- Use more code check tools? flake8, pyflakes, pylint, pychecker?
- Support Python 3 type annotations?
- Try to ignore less PEP8 rules.
- Use "psutil" to write tests that profile memory usage?
