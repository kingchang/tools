- Plugin architecture: pipes to child processes, specific exit error status code if it can't handle, get_name() : char*, run(int argc, char* argv[], char* options[]) : int
- Tests with coverage.
- Continuous integration.
- Profiling.
- Allow iterating using only callbacks to avoid allocating memory and to be faster?
- Try to improve readability with more helper functions?
- Add a set data type? (To store disabled plugin names.)
- Input transformation: syntax highlighting, code reformatting, show whitespace.
- Plugin ideas: Git commits, perldoc, pydoc
