- Passthrough `ls` exit status?
- Avoid allocating plugin names for each option.
- What to do when the `cat` and `ls` plugins are both enabled? E.g. `$ echo test | ./show .`
- Tests with coverage.
- Continuous integration.
- Profiling.
- Allow iterating using only callbacks to avoid allocating memory and to be faster?
- Try to improve readability with more helper functions?
- Input transformation: syntax highlighting, code reformatting, show whitespace.
- Plugin ideas: Git commits, perldoc, pydoc
